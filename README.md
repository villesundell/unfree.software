# List of [Unfree.Software](https://unfree.software)
This is a list of popular software whose source code is published but without a valid license approved by the FSF or OSI. It adheres to the [Awesome format](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/pull_request_template.md) for interoperability.

These projects may misleadingly operate as if they were proper open-source or free software projects, while the project owner still retains [essential freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition). You can read more about this old-new phenomenon at [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/open-source-is-everywhere-but-so-is-fake-open-source-jh8a33fi).
